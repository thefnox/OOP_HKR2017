# Fernando's code for Object Oriented Programming
I figured it would be nice to keep my code from this class public for didactic reasons. I'll  be committing the code from lectures and exercises to this repository. You don't need to know Git to really use it, you can just read the code online, if you want to get an update every time I upload something, just watch this repo.
